1.Augumentation on training set /  use synthetic data generations using ML.
2.Model generalisability - Parameters are Region and Population Density.
3.Mentioned about BSES. 
4.Work upon segmentation principles and then Detection .--> yield out better accuracy and per capita Income generation.
5.Work on the two parameters -- "Direction" and "Tilt" of Solar panels also study how much they effect .
6.Look into the refernces that are set by Google API's .
7.We should change the model of Solar Detector and try for any better one.
8.ISRO- Need to search ISRO's website and see if there is any provision being made to available the data for research faciltiy.
9.ANKIT SIR -  Will update regarding power generation for IIT Delhi.
10.For Power Genr=eration , we need to look upon certain parameters like Dust, Location ,Time, Weather .
11. Determine How is the efficiency being calculated(only area wise or some other parameter also?) , how is the tilt determined , etc.
12.Timeline of the solarpanel, how old is it.
13.See the governmnet projects like PM Suryaghar Bijli Yojna ...is it really successful? or it fails when power supply is cut ?
14.HPC account sign in.
